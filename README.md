API FOR AN ONLINE TASK LIST

Hello, I made this API that has express, sequelize, dotenv, jwt, bcrypt, babel, cors and yup.

Utility of each package:

° Express for building the web server;
° Sequelize to manipulate the database (Postgres);
° Dotenv to protect database information (Password);
° JWT to create a validation token;
° Bcrypt to encrypt the user's password;
° Babel to convert the ECMA code
° Cors is here releasing for everyone to consume the API.
° Yup for field validation.
